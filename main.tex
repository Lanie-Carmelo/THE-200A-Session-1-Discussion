\section{What is your present concept of God? Explain.}
I think of God as a loving Father, someone who wants the best for me and understands me even when I feel like no one else does. I do not have a good relationship with my earthly father, as he has never been there for me and seems uncomfortable around me, perhaps due to my disabilities, so this concept of God has always stood out to me. I often feel lonely and like no one understands what I go through as a blind, autistic woman with a lengthy list of health conditions, and it can help to remember that Jesus Christ understands what I go through when I feel this way. This understanding of God as a loving Father who knows and cares for me is consistent with what \textcite{erickson_introducing_2015} describes as Godâ€™s self-revelation through Scripture and through Jesus Christ.
